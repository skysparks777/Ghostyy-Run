# Ghostyy-Run
This game, titled "Escape the Room", is a Halloween-themed adventure where players control a friendly ghost (👻) trying to escape from a spooky room filled with sleepy and watchful guardians, eerie pumpkins, and bats. The ghost’s objective is to reach the escape door (🏰) without getting caught by the watchers (👀).

Players use the arrow keys to navigate the ghost around the room while avoiding the watchers, who randomly switch between sleepy (😪), yawning (🥱), and alert (👀) states. If the ghost is spotted by a watcher, the game resets, challenging the player to try again.

With a moody, dark-themed background and playful characters, this game is both spooky and lighthearted, capturing the spirit of Halloween while testing the player’s stealth and timing.
